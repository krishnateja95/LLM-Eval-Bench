It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

Other doctors say the women must be carefully watched to see how well a transplanted uterus functions. \"It is a good sign they have done the transfers,\" said a doctor. \"But a live birth will be the best validation that this works.\" Controversy has surrounded the Swedish project because it accepted wombs from live women who are friends or family of the patients, creating possible health risks for the donors. Two other womb transplant attempts, in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, failed to produce a child; only the Turkish donation was from a dead donor."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1201}

UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

This decision was made after a two-year investigation by theologians found no evidence of fraud or heresy, and follows a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures, and other signs of divine intervention. The apparitions were first reported in 1859 by a young woman named Adele Brise, who said she was visited by Mary three times in a bright light surrounded by trees. The church has been slow to recognize such apparitions, but the decree in Wisconsin is seen as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. The shrine is now attracting visitors from around the world, including a group of Catholic leaders from New York who are planning to visit by the busload. The church's scandals did not influence the decision, but if the shrine can become a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, \"that would be beautiful.\" The Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops, who are wary of fraud and generally reluctant to investigate claims. Over the 20th century, some 386 major apparitions of Mary were reported, and about 75 of those were studied, with only a dozen recognized as valid. The church makes use of psychiatric examinations and brain scans to see if people making claims are mentally healthy and not having hallucinations.

In 1859, a Belgian immigrant named Adele Brise said Mary—a dazzling white figure with cascading blond hair and a crown of stars, hovering between a pair of trees—appeared to her three times and instructed her to spend her life teaching Catholic beliefs to children. A two-year investigation that concluded on Dec. 8 found no evidence of fraud or heresy, but did find a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures, and other indications of divine intervention, leading Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay to declare “with moral certainty” that Brise had encounters “of a supernatural character” that are “worthy of belief.” The Vatican, wary of fraud, gives local bishops the primary responsibility of evaluating apparitions, in part by using guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978.

The decision was reportedly made by the magazine's founder and current editor-in-chief, Hugh Hefner, and comes as a result of the internet's dominance in providing free pornographic content. Playboy's circulation has dropped significantly over the years, from 5.6 million in the 1970s to around 800,000 currently, and the magazine is looking to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. The move is seen as a response to the changing times and the shift in consumer behavior, with many young men turning to other publications such as Vice for their fix of provocative content.

The removal of nude photos may actually boost the magazine's articles, which have long been a highlight of the publication, according to some media experts.

Medicinal cups of pink and red liquid were found near his body. Yonatan weighed only 34 pounds when he was found, and his death is believed to be a result of neglect and abuse.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the effectiveness of the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in investigating and protecting children from abuse and neglect.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council is urged to take action to maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean by setting conservative catch limits and prohibiting unregulated fishing on forage fish species. The decline of sardines is attributed to a combination of natural fluctuations and overfishing, and scientists warn that the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds, and fishermen could suffer for years if the population does not recover soon. The articles also highlight the importance of sardines as a crucial forage fish, providing food for commercially important predators such as salmon and tuna, and the potential impact of their decline on the entire food web.

One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions written in the US are inappropriate, with 506 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 population annually. Of these, 353 were likely appropriate, highlighting the need for establishing a goal for outpatient antibiotic stewardship. The study also found that 13% of all outpatient visits result in an antibiotic prescription, with 44% of prescriptions being written to treat acute respiratory conditions. However, half of these prescriptions are unnecessary due to the prevalence of viral illnesses. Better communication between doctors and patients regarding the dangers of antibiotic overuse can lead to more appropriate prescribing. The CDC has identified the need to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020, which could be achieved by cutting outpatient antibiotic use by 15% overall. The overuse of antibiotics has led to the rise of drug-resistant superbugs, which already cause an estimated 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths annually in the US.", "answers": ["Scientists have been concerned for some time about \"Phantom Menace\"-type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest CDC data finds that 2 million people a year in the US are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the CDC and the Pew Charitable Trusts—the first research to quantify this issue, per the Washington Post—isn't encouraging. A study published Tuesday in JAMA finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions (around 47 million per year) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections—meaning the Rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ERs and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6% walked out with an antibiotic script, per the Pharmacy Times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The Times notes President Obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50% by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we'll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15% to meet that. \"If we continue down the road of inappropriate use we'll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden says. \"Losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [and] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma.\" (Here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3153}

The study analyzed 50 homes in the Austin area and found that west-facing panels are more effective at capturing solar energy late in the afternoon, which coincides with the time when homeowners tend to use the most electricity, particularly for air conditioning. The study suggests that homeowners with west-facing panels are optimizing their solar power generation at the time when their own usage surges, and when the utility company needs the most help coping with demand. The findings of the study could have widespread efficiency implications beyond single homes and may prompt utility companies to rethink their opposition to west-facing panels.", "answers": ["If you happen to have solar panels on your house, they might need a change of direction.

The study also found that substituting potatoes with other vegetables, legumes, or whole grains may help lower the risk of gestational diabetes.

So suggests a National Institutes of Health study published Tuesday in the BMJ that found women who eat more potatoes before becoming pregnant may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes as compared to their spud-light counterparts. That finding stems from an analysis of 15,632 women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II over a 10-year period beginning in 1991. A press release explains the women had not previously had gestational diabetes, and at four-year intervals answered questions related to their diet in the year prior. Under the potato category, they were asked to rate their consumption of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, fries, or potato chips on a scale of \"never\" to \"six or more times a day.\" The researchers begin their study by noting just how prevalent potato consumption is, with 35% of American women ages 19-50 eating potatoes daily, and the vegetable accounting for 8% of their caloric intake. Study author Dr. Cuilin Zhang recommends to CBS News that women cap it at one potato portion per week and consider a swap. The researchers estimate that trading two servings of potatoes weekly for a substitute vegetable, legumes, or whole-grain food would reduce the risk of gestational diabetes—which CBS reports affects as many as 8% of pregnancies—by 9% to 12%.

Cosby has remained mostly silent about the allegations, though he commented in an interview over the weekend that the “black media” should remain “neutral” on the charges against him. Cosby's wife, Camille, issued a statement defending her husband as “the man you thought you knew.” The allegations against Cosby come amid a flurry of allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than a dozen women.

The growing number of climbers on the mountain, many of whom are inexperienced, has led to concerns about safety and the potential for a catastrophic accident. Additionally, the Nepalese government has announced that it will provide $400 to the families of the Sherpas killed in an avalanche, sparking outrage among the Sherpa community who are demanding higher compensation.

His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest—one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain).

This planet, which they call Planet Nine, would be located at the edge of the solar system and would be significantly more massive than Eris, a dwarf planet currently considered to be the most massive object in the Kuiper Belt. Brown and Batygin base their findings on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate that the planet will be detected via telescope within five years.\n\nBrown is known for his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status in 2006, and some have criticized him for his involvement in the decision. However, Brown argues that the International Astronomical Union's definition of a planet is flawed and that Pluto should not be considered a planet. He suggests that the focus should be on understanding the solar system as it really is, rather than living in the past and debating Pluto's status.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet, but Brown and Batygin argue that this is not a viable solution. They suggest that embracing the reality of Pluto's status as an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt rather than continuing to debate its planet status is a more productive approach.\n\nOverall, the news passages highlight the ongoing debate over the definition of a planet and the status of Pluto and other objects in the solar system.

The mission marks the end of NASA's effort to explore every planet in the solar system, and it coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first flyby of Mars by the Mariner 4 probe.\n\nStudying Pluto can provide clues about Earth's history, including how the planet formed and what its water composition is. The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, capturing details up to 100 meters across. The mission will also help scientists understand the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy debris outside the orbit of Neptune where Pluto is found.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft has spent nine years traveling to Pluto, and it will take 16 months for all of the flyby data to reach Earth.

The research, published in the Astrophysical Journal, suggests that the universe is expanding at a faster rate than previously thought, with a margin of error of just 2.4 percent.

Ben Beard, who helps run the CDC's Zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in Louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the Zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters.

Monis had a history of religiously inspired activism and was convicted of sending offensive letters to the families of deceased Australian soldiers in 2009. He was facing a raft of criminal charges, including accessory to murder and sexual assault charges, and had been granted bail. On Friday, the High Court dismissed Monis' appeal against his previous convictions.\n\nOn Monday morning, police were called to the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Sydney following reports of an armed robbery, and it soon emerged that a gunman was holding hostages. Three men and two women managed to sprint to safety from the cafe's side door, and five hostages escaped early on Tuesday as commandos stormed the cafe. Monis was killed in the siege, along with two hostages.\n\nThe siege came to a violent end at 2:00 AM on Tuesday, when special operations officers advanced towards the cafe's side door. More hostages escaped, running to safety on Elizabeth Street, and commandos stormed the cafe via several entrances. Police officially confirmed the end of the siege at 2:45 AM, and later reported the deaths of three people, including the gunman.\n\nThe Australian National Imams Council issued a statement expressing sadness at the tragic end to the siege and offering condolences to the families of those killed and the hostages who suffered trauma. At a news conference on Tuesday, NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn would not say whether Monis had shot the two hostages himself, but confirmed that all the hostages had acted courageously.\n\nThe siege has raised questions about Monis' mental health and his radicalization, with some experts suggesting that he may have been consumed by a sense of grievance and marginalization. The incident has also highlighted the need for authorities to prioritize suspects and prevent radicalization, particularly in the wake of the Sydney siege.", "answers": ["As Australia mourns two hostages killed in a Sydney cafe yesterday, many are wondering what gunman Man Haron Monis was doing on the streets in the first place. The Iranian-born cleric, who was killed when police commandos stormed the cafe, was on bail for around 50 counts of sexual and indecent assault and for charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. The 31-year-old mother of two was stabbed repeatedly and set on fire with the use of lighter fluid last April, allegedly by Monis' girlfriend. The crime happened in an apartment stairwell. More: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the government will look into why the 50-year-old was out on bail and why he did not appear on the country's terrorist watch list, the BBC reports. \"How can someone who has had such a long and checkered history not be on the appropriate watch lists, and how can someone like that be entirely at large in the community?\" he wondered at a press conference today. \"These are questions that we need to look at carefully and calmly and methodically.\" Just three days before he walked into the cafe with a gun and took 17 people hostage, Monis had failed in an attempt to overturn a conviction for sending \"grossly offensive\" letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The country's High Court rejected his application to hear a fresh constitutional challenge to the charges against him, for which he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service. Monis, who declared himself to be a sheikh and a \"spiritual healer,\" was seen as a \"fringe figure\" in Sydney's Islamic community, according to a Guardian profile. Shia Muslim leaders had asked police to probe his claims to be a leading cleric and last week, he announced on his website that he had converted to Sunni Islam and pledged allegiance to ISIS. The lawyer who represented Monis in the murder case tells the Australian Broadcasting Company that his client, who came to the country as a refugee in 1996, may have thought he had \"nothing to lose,\" hence \"participating in something as desperate and outrageous as this.\" He says that while in prison, Monis suffered some \"very unpleasant events, involving matters of excrement over himself and his cell,\" and he is certain that the siege was the act of a \"one-off random individual,\" not an organized terrorist group."], "all_classes": null, "length": 4410}

The film's poor performance is attributed to its confusing release date, as it was released on Independence Day weekend, which is usually a busy time for blockbuster movies.\n3. The film's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book was praised for its visual effects and motion capture acting, but it was criticized for its lack of depth and complexity compared to the original material.\n4.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book—Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory—has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4655}

Passage 2 explores the evolutionary perspective on sexism, arguing that low-status males increase female-directed hostility to minimize the loss of status due to hierarchical reconfiguration resulting from the entrance of a woman into the competitive arena. The study used an online first-person shooter video game to test the hypothesis that female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behavior from poor performing males. The results showed that lower-skilled players were more hostile towards a female-voiced teammate, especially when performing poorly, while higher-skilled players behaved more positively towards a female relative to a male teammate.

Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts.

A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: After all, the Post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers' \"pre-existing social hierarchy\"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \"As men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank,\" the study notes.

As Politico reports, Hyde-Pierce has never trailed in the polls and continues to be the favorite to win, but a string of controversies—starting with her joke about a public hanging—has given Espy a bigger-than-expected shot at becoming the state's first black senator since Reconstruction. \"A wounded front-runner\" is how a political science professor in Jackson describes Hyde-Smith to Reuters. President Trump easily won the state in 2016, and he held two rallies there Monday for his fellow Republican. \"Her heart is good,\" Trump said of Hyde-Smith, per CNN. Trump called her controversial joke \"sad and a little flip,\" but he defended her explanation that it was meant as a good-natured way of praising a supporter. \"When I spoke to her—she called me—she said, 'I said something that I meant exactly very different,' and I heard an apology loud and clear,\" Trump said. As for Espy: \"How does he fit in with Mississippi?\" the president asked, as noted by CNBC. \"I mean, how does he fit in?\" The website FiveThirtyEight reports that a survey last week had Hyde-Smith up 54% to 44%.

The program aims to encourage workers to think about what they want and only retain those who truly want to work at Amazon. Additionally, Bezos highlights the importance of hiring and retaining talented and motivated employees, and prioritizing their compensation to stock options rather than cash. He also emphasizes the company's focus on continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses. Furthermore, Bezos outlines Amazon's goals for 1998, including solidifying and extending its brand and customer base, adding new products such as music, and better serving customers overseas.

The first year the offer is made, it’s for $2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches $5,000. The headline on the offer is 'Please Don’t Take This Offer.'

The Interfraternity Conference, which represents 75 national fraternities, opposed the ban and emailed and met with Cal Poly administrators. The conference also paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders. Freshmen deaths related to fraternities account for 40% of all fraternity-related deaths nationwide since 2005, with 24 deaths occurring during and after recruiting events. Fraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, drinking deaths at fraternities are \"heartbreaking,\" and many students drink too much, not just at fraternities. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \"man\" but on his planning-for-retirement parents. The opposing positions on this matter are held by Douglas Fierberg, the best plaintiff's attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference. Fierberg is a man of obvious and deep intelligence, comfortable with sharply correcting a fuzzy thought, using obscenities, and speaking derisively, even contemptuously, of opponents. He is also the man to run to as though one's hair were on fire if one ever finds oneself in a legal battle with a fraternity. Smithhisler, on the other hand, is the senior fraternity man ne plus ultra, unfailingly and sometimes elaborately courteous, careful in his choice of words, unflappable, and as unlikely to interrupt or drop the f-bomb on a respectful female journalist as he would be to join the Communist Party. He believes that the fraternity experience at its best constitutes an appeal to a young man's better angels through service, leadership training, and accountability for mistakes.", "answers": ["Frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they're impossible to ignore—but how did it get this bad, and why does it keep happening? In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University—and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow—so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives—like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

Too 'fussy': David Leonhardt at the New York Times thinks \"it's time to shed some of the fussy over-precision about the relationship between climate change and weather.\" The evidence is overwhelming that human-caused climate change results in storms such as Harvey, he writes, and our timidness in admitting it is holding up solutions.

But he, too, says it's clear that heavier rain is an undisputed consequence. \"In fact, due to sea level rise and more moisture in the air, I expect flooding to be the most frequent public face of climate change over the next decade or so.\" Media coverage: You won't hear much about climate change in the current news coverage because reporters don't want to \"politicize\" the situation, writes Naomi Klein at the Intercept. \"But here's the thing: Every time we act as if an unprecedented weather event is hitting us out of the blue, as some sort of Act of God that no one foresaw, reporters are making a highly political decision,\" she notes.

The results of the study are potentially the first step towards abolishing completely locked-in states, at least for ALS patients.\n\nThe study used a BCI based on fNIRS, which measures brain hemodynamic responses associated with neuronal activity, to overcome the barrier of communication in patients suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing, known as completely locked-in state. Despite scientific and technological advances, communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing.\n\nThe study found that the patients were able to communicate \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to auditory presented questions, and the BCI was employed successfully to train the patients to regulate their frontocentral brain regions in response to auditorily presented questions. The patients were given feedback of their affirmative or negative response to questions with known answers and open questions over weeks.\n\nThe study also showed that the patients were able to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to simple questions with known positive answers or negative answers and some open questions over an extensive time period.

The plan also includes a $1 trillion infrastructure program, but does not include new funding amounts or a tax mechanism for it. The budget extensively targets Obama programs and investments focused on climate change, seeking to eliminate payments to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund and cut research funding for climate, ocean, and earth science programs.

The budget goes after frequent targets of the party's staunchest conservatives, such as foreign aid and domestic agencies that had been protected by former President Barack Obama. The proposal covers only roughly one-fourth of the approximately $4 trillion federal budget and does not address taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The budget is expected to land with a thud on Capitol Hill, with opposition Democrats outraged over cuts to pet programs and Republicans irate over planned elimination of a program to restore the Great Lakes.

{"pred": " In a recent study, researchers have discovered the likely cause of the mysterious death of the crew of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley during the American Civil War. The study, published in the journal Plos One, suggests that the crew died due to a blast wave generated by the sub's own torpedo, which was filled with black powder and attached to a pole from the ship's hull. The blast wave hit the sub's hull, which was less than an inch thick, and bent ever so slightly but fast enough to transfer the blast wave to the inside of the cabin. The wave then traveled through the cabin, hitting each of the eight crew members, and probably caused the blood vessels in their lungs to rupture, leading to their death. The study's lead author, biomechanics Rachel Lance, designed a model of the Hunley, one-sixth the length of the 40-foot-long submarine, and set off test explosions near the model to simulate the blast wave. The experiment showed that the blast wave could have killed the crew instantly without leaving any lasting mark on the sub's hull. The study supports the conclusion that the blast wave theory is the most plausible explanation for the crew's death, and suggests that the Hunley's sinking may have been a tragic accident rather than a deliberate act of sabotage.", "answers": ["For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery—and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it.

Over three years, Lance—a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself—carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive … analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000.

{"pred": " Bernie Sanders is pushing for a \"Medicare for All\" bill in the US, which would provide universal healthcare to all citizens. The bill would be funded by a progressive tax system and would save Americans $6 trillion over the next decade. The proposal has gained traction among Democrats, with several senators already expressing support. However, the bill faces significant political obstacles, as Republicans control Congress and the presidency. Despite this, the idea of single-payer healthcare is gaining popularity among the public, with a recent poll showing that 53% of Americans support a national healthcare plan. Several Democratic presidential contenders, including Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have already expressed support for the bill. The proposal would also address the issue of long-term care, which Sanders had included in his previous version of the bill but will be addressed in separate legislation. The bill would roll out over a four-year transition period, starting with expanding Medicare coverage to dental, vision, and hearing aid benefits, while reducing the eligibility age to 55. Over the next two years, the Medicare age would drop to 45, then 35 years old, and by the fourth year, everyone would be eligible. Notable absences from the event included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who are both up for reelection in 2018. Single-payer activists are delighted with the momentum gained after years of effort to transform the healthcare system.", "answers": ["Bernie Sanders rolled out his vision to overhaul the health care system on Wednesday, one in which everybody would get their insurance from the government through Medicare instead of through their jobs or a private insurer. Sanders calls it the Medicare for All Act of 2017, but you'll also hear phrases such as \"single payer\" and \"universal health care\" used to describe it. One key part missing: details on how to pay for it, though Sanders plans to release a separate paper on that, reports the Wall Street Journal. Coverage: The basics: Per CNN, everybody gets a \"Universal Medicare card,\" which would be used to cover all health bills, from surgeries to dental care to substance abuse treatment. Co-payments would go away, and people would pay premiums based on their incomes, reports the AP. Private insurers would still exist, but for things such as elective plastic surgery or, sometimes, to act as middlemen between the government and hospitals or doctors. A 'right': Sanders makes his case in an op-ed in the New York Times. \"Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.\" 'Single payer': David Leonhardt of the New York Times has a Q&A on the fundamentals, including the basic question of what the term \"single payer\" means. In short, it \"describes a system in which only one entity—the government—pays medical bills. If all Americans had Medicare rather than insurance through their jobs, it would be a single-payer system.\" Vox says Sanders' system is far more generous than single-payer plans in Canada and elsewhere. The cost: This could cost hundreds of billions of dollars more per year, per the Journal. Details are yet to come, but Sanders envisions a progressive tax increase, with the wealthy paying more income, capital gains, and estate taxes, reports Newsweek. The senator says higher taxes for families would be offset by the fact that they no longer have to buy insurance. Still, in regard to single-payer systems, \"no one—including Sanders—has truly reckoned with how to pay for whatever system they might support,\" writes Mike Allen at Axios. Litmus test? By all accounts, the chances of it passing a GOP-controlled Congress are precisely 0%. But it's turning into a political litmus test of sorts for Democrats, reports the Washington Post.

But Bacon lays out the political and policy reasons why Democrats might avoid \"becoming the party of single payer.\" Relishing the fight: Republicans see a chance to pounce. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" says Katie Martin, spokesperson for the Senate GOP's campaign organization, per the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 12075}

The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group.

For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings—until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life.

{"pred": " A recent study published in the journal Translational Psychiatry has found that older fathers are more likely to have \"geekier\" sons who are more intelligent and focused on their interests. The study analyzed data from over 15,000 twins and found that boys whose fathers were older scored higher on a \"geek index\" measuring traits such as non-verbal IQ, ability to focus, and social aloofness. The study also found that the link between autism and older paternal age is likely due to genetic factors, with geekiness being heritable and transmitted to offspring. However, the study's authors caution that the findings should not be used to guide individual decisions about parenthood, as the effects may operate differently in individual families.\n\nThe study also found that gender differences in geekiness are not fully explained, and it could be due to differences in how the brains of boys and girls develop.

However, with a higher \"dose\" of these genes and other contributing risk factors, they may end up with a higher predisposition for autism.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the potential benefits of having an older father, including the possibility of having children who are more intelligent and focused on their interests.

More specifically, they tend to score higher on what the researchers call the \"geek index,\" reports the Guardian. And this is clearly seen as a positive: \"If you look at who does well in life right now, it’s geeks,\" says Magdalena Janecka at King’s College London. The geek index, she explains, is determined by such factors as ability to focus, non-verbal IQ scores taken at age 12, and social aloofness. The latter trait may sound like a negative, but the BBC frames it as the boys not being overly concerned with fitting in. A mother's age appears to have no impact. The team studied more than 7,000 sets of twins in the UK. The average geek score for boys born to dads 25 or younger is 39. It goes up to 41 when dads had the child between 35 and 44, and jumps to 47 when dads were 50 or older.
